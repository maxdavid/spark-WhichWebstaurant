# Which Webstaurant?

Files used for the *Which Webstaurant?* Spark AR filter. This filter was made in collaboration with [WebstaurantStore](http://webstaurantstore.com) to ride the wave of popularity from the very common randomizer-style filters on Instagram, with a tongue-in-cheek version of their own.

Filter accessible on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/a/r/?effect_id=472799526995455).

Subfolder `Webstaurant` contains all the final project files.
